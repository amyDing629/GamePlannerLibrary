        <h1>Sport Games Planner</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <b>This library’s main purpose is to show sport games’ information in a decent way. The sport games information includes games name (eg. NBA), time, duration, competing players/teams, type of sports, location/platforms, and game results for past games. The information will be shown with a table by weeks or days. Weeks table only include players and games name (if exists). Days table will display all information of the events. End users can choose to display either Week table of Day table. For either past or future events, they can click ‘last’ and ‘next’ to flip pages to see events for different weeks or days. They can also filter events, such as by game name, players/teams, type of sports, location/platforms, and time. For events that have result details or event details,they can click on the related button on the event (in Day table) to see the contents. It would be useful for developers since the minimum things they need to do is just to provide events data, and the table and all related functionalities will be created automatically. </b>
